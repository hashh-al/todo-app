# Todo App

A simple, interactive Todo App built with Node.js and Express.js. This application allows users to manage tasks effectively with features to add and delete tasks.

## Features

- Simple, clean UI for managing todos

## Project Structure

- **views/**: Contains the EJS templates for rendering HTML.

## MySQL Database

This app uses MySQL as the database to store tasks. 

### Database Setup

1. Install MySQL on your system if you haven't already.
2. Create a database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE sample_database;
   ```

3. Create a table to store tasks:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE todos (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   task VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```
4. Update the MySQL connection settings in your app to match your database configuration. Make sure to add your MySQL `username`, `password`,`database name` and `localhost` settings in `app.js`.
